# Exangular app
My first attempt at developing a MEAN stack app, please be gentle.

In order to run this, you'll need [bower](http://bower.io/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), as well as a mongoDB connection running.

Clone the repo, navigate to the folder and install all dependencies:

`npm install`

`bower install`

And run the project with:

`grunt`
